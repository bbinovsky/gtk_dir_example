pyGTK Directory Example

What is it?

This is purely an example of pyGTK TreeView with a scrollable list.
It's a list of the files on /usr/bin/ available on most *nix systems.
The list can be drag & drop reordered.
The list of files can be sorted into alphabetical order by clicking the 1st column header.

What does it show?

Shows object-oriented programming.
Shows a basic understading of the GTK GUI library.
Shows event handling in GTK using Python.

Shortcomings?

Doesn't have much in the way of file system error handling right now.
